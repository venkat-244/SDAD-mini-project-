Social Distancing Alert Device :

Social distancing alert device (SDAD) is a hardware-based project.  In the present times, as Covid -19 pandemic has been rampant, we need to be cautious in the social and public gatherings.  It is a miniaturized version to ensure that social distancing is maintained.  It is a simple gadget which can be up-scaled later for larger uses in offices, worksites, ration shops , ticket counters, railway stations ,airports and public places wherever queue system is found .In this project we used the Arduino Uno development board , an ultra-sonic sensor and a speaker. We set a threshold distance between two human beings which is the minimum distance to ensure social distancing. If the threshold is not satisfied, then we get a voice alert that technically corrects the positioning. This is a simple use of technology to prevent violation of the Covid norms.


Working of SDAD:
•	In the beginning, we give the power supply to the device.
•	Both the ultra-sonic sensors detect the distances D1 and D2 between the reference person and the ones behind him/her and to their right /left according to the arrangement of the device.
•	Once the distances are detected, they are then compared to the threshold distance 6 feet (180 cm).
•	When the threshold is not satisfied ,automatically the speaker gives an alert to maintain social distancing
•	By this alert, the people in the surroundings also get alerted and reposition themselves accordingly.
•	Hence, Social distancing can be maintained at the public queues
